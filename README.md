# Final Project for CS 147 - UCI

This project involves integrating various sensors to create a comprehensive system. Below are the sensors used in this project, along with the necessary libraries and resources.

## Sensors

### 1. CAP1188 - 8-Key Capacitive Touch Sensor
This sensor is used for capacitive touch input with 8 touch pads.

- **Library:** [Adafruit CAP1188 Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CAP1188_Library/blob/fad505c68f5e29027d68553c7f3d10a9b690d0ae/examples/cap1188test/cap1188test.ino)

### 2. SparkFun Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor (MAX30101 & MAX32664)
This sensor is used for measuring heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2).

- **Library:** [SparkFun Bio Sensor Hub Library](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/sparkfun/SparkFun%20Bio%20Sensor%20Hub%20Library)

### 3. LSM6DSO Accelerometer/Gyroscope
This sensor provides 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF) motion sensing, including both accelerometer and gyroscope functionalities.

- **Library:** [SparkFun Qwiic 6DoF - LSM6DSO Library](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/sparkfun/SparkFun%20Qwiic%206Dof%20-%20LSM6DSO/installation)
